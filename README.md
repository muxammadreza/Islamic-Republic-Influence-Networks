Use of this data is **strictly limited** to:

- Academic research
- Investigative journalism
- Human-rights documentation
- OSINT analysis
- Transparency purposes

### ❌ The dataset must NOT be used to:

- Harass, doxx, or target individuals

## 📖 Overview

This dataset is the result of systematic collection and analysis of publicly available Twitter (X) account metadata. It documents accounts exhibiting observable patterns consistent with amplification activities across multiple political influence ecosystems operating in the Persian-language information space.

The dataset currently includes approximately **7,100 accounts** across three datasets, identified through graph-based analysis of public engagement data alongside open-source account listings.

> **Note:** The term "network" is used in a technical, analytical sense referring to graph relationships and interaction patterns. It does not imply organizational membership, formal coordination, or command-and-control structures. See the [Legal Disclaimer](#-legal-ethical-and-methodological-disclaimer) for full details.

## 📁 Dataset Contents

| File                  | Accounts | Description                                                                              |
| --------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `IR-Network.json`     | ~2,900   | Accounts exhibiting engagement patterns with Islamic Republic state-affiliated media     |
| `MEK.json`            | ~1,800   | Accounts exhibiting engagement patterns with Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK)-related content     |
| `White-Internet.json` | ~2,400   | Accounts listed in the White Internet database with publicly cataloged account metadata  |

### Network Descriptions

**IR-Network** — Accounts exhibiting observable engagement patterns with official Islamic Republic media channels (state TV, news agencies, government figures). Patterns were identified based on publicly available interaction data; inclusion does not constitute a determination of affiliation, coordination, or intent.

**MEK** — Accounts exhibiting observable engagement patterns with content related to the Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK), an exiled opposition organization. The MEK is a formerly armed group that was designated as a terrorist organization by multiple governments (including the United States until 2012 and the European Union until 2009) before being delisted. This dataset documents observed amplification patterns only and does not attribute any account to MEK membership, coordination, or formal affiliation.

Both network clusters represent opposing political positions but exhibit similar observable engagement patterns. The term "network" is used in a technical, graph-analytical sense and does not imply organizational structure, command relationships, or coordinated intent.

**White Internet** — Accounts listed in the open-source White Internet database, which aggregates publicly visible account metadata and inferred attributes. Inclusion indicates presence in the source listing only and should not be treated as evidence of affiliation, intent, or activity.

## 🗂️ Data Structure

Each entry contains the following fields:

```json
{
  "creation_date": "Fri Jun 16 14:30:49 +0000 2017",
  "user_id": "875722335449489414",
  "username": "example_user",
  "name": "Display Name",
  "follower_count": 1893,
  "following_count": 2104,
  "favourites_count": null,
  "is_private": null,
  "is_verified": null,
  "is_blue_verified": false,
  "location": null,
  "profile_pic_url": null,
  "profile_banner_url": null,
  "description": "Account bio text",
  "external_url": null,
  "number_of_tweets": 188378,
  "bot": false,
  "timestamp": 1497623449,
  "has_nft_avatar": false,
  "category": null,
  "default_profile": true,
  "default_profile_image": false,
  "listed_count": 10,
  "verified_type": null
}
```

### Field Notes

- **Profile images intentionally excluded**: `profile_pic_url` and `profile_banner_url` are set to `null` by design to prevent biometric identification risks
- **No tweet content**: Dataset contains only account-level metadata, not individual tweets
- **Nullable fields**: Some fields may be `null` depending on public availability at time of collection

### White Internet Schema Notes

`White-Internet.json` includes account handles, display names, username-change history, account status, device type, location indicators, inferred gender, and a permanent user ID (stored as a string), plus optional same-person fields when the source dataset flagged potential overlaps.
Usernames retain the leading `@` from the source list; remove it for cross-dataset joins.
Location and gender are inferred from platform signals and should be treated as probabilistic.

The `location_status` field uses reliability codes (`continent_only`, `iran`, `non_iran_only`) to reflect how confidently a country could be inferred; entries that are not `iran` are less reliable for geographic inference. The `same_person_account` field captures linked handles when provided, and `same_person_detected` is set to `true` only when the source flagged likely overlaps. Some fields may explicitly be `unknown` where the source used unmapped or missing values—these should be treated as unknowns, not negative assertions.

## 🔬 Methodology

### Collection Approach

Data was collected exclusively from **publicly accessible information** on the Twitter (X) platform through automated retrieval of account metadata. Collection focused on accounts exhibiting statistically observable engagement patterns with content from channels publicly identified as state-affiliated or organization-affiliated.

> **Note:** Collection and inclusion are based solely on publicly observable behavioral patterns. No claim is made regarding the identity, intent, nationality, affiliation, or motivations of any account holder.

### Identification Criteria

Accounts were included based on observable indicators, including:

- Engagement pattern analysis (retweet frequency, timing, graph clustering)
- Cross-referencing with publicly documented research on influence ecosystems
- Behavioral consistency metrics

> **Important:** These criteria identify statistical patterns only. Inclusion does not constitute an accusation of wrongdoing, coordination, or affiliation with any government, organization, or political group. All classifications are **analytical, descriptive, and probabilistic** — not factual or legal determinations.

### Quality Assurance

- Manual verification performed on sampled subsets to assess pattern consistency
- Accounts with insufficient signal-to-noise ratio excluded from the dataset
- Estimated pattern-matching accuracy: >90%
- Estimated composition: ~95% human-operated accounts; accounts exhibiting primarily automated behavior were excluded

> **Disclaimer:** Despite quality assurance measures, false positives and false negatives may occur. The dataset is subject to inherent OSINT limitations and should not be treated as complete, definitive, or authoritative. Users are encouraged to independently verify and contextualize any findings.
